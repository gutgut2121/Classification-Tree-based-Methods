# Classification of Beans using Tree-based Methods
The goal of this project is to classify the types of dry beans using tree-based methods. We aim to determine whether tree-based methods provide accurate analysis in classifying the types of beans in our dataset and identify the variables that are most influential in generating the best bean-classification model. Additionally, we explore alternative approaches to improve the accuracy of our bean-classification model.

# Dataset
We have a dataset containing information about various characteristics of beans. Each instance in the dataset represents a bean sample, and the target variable indicates the type of bean. The dataset includes several predictor variables such as size, shape, color, and texture.

# Project Questions
1. Do tree-based methods provide an accurate analysis in classifying the types of dry beans found in our dataset? 

We will explore the performance of tree-based methods to evaluate their accuracy in classifying the types of dry beans. 

2. Which variables should be selected to generate the best bean-classification model? 

We will perform feature selection techniques to identify the variables that have the most significant impact on classifying the types of beans. By selecting the most informative variables, we aim to create a more accurate and interpretable bean-classification model.

3. What other ways could be done to improve the accuracy of our bean-classification model? 

Apart from variable selection, we will explore additional methods to enhance the accuracy of our bean-classification model. This may include data preprocessing techniques like normalization or scaling. By incorporating these strategies, we aim to achieve better classification results.
